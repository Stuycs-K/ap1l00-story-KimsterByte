Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no rock
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on rock, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about 
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the rock. It is a way I have of driving off the
rock and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the rock;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my rock; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin rock, and bringing up the rear of every rock I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the rock, and methodically
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's rock off—then, I account it high time to get to rock as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all rock in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the rock with me.
